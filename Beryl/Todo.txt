PRIORITY    OWNER       DESCRIPTION
high        Mikael      Type-check expressions properly.  Also see if constant expressions can't be folded.

high        Alexandre   Begin to generate code for non-predefined functions as the interface to the predefined functions may
                        change.

low         Mikael      Finish up the string type; currently the scanner and parser can recognize the string type but the checker
                        does not handle it.

done        Mikael      Finish up registering the predefined Triangle environment; currently it is only partially defined because
                        Beryl does not yet support operator or function overloading.
                        :: Beryl now supports operator overloading.
